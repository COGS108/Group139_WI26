    "While the genre has been around since the 1980’s, it wasn't until recently that the genre has really taken off. Just in 2024, the genre made up 15% of new release anime tv shows with 34 isekai being released. However with the rise of the genre, it \n",

    "Knowing this our group has decided to explore the truth behind how the audience really feels about the genre. By analyzing more than a decade of industry data and user reviews through MyAnimeList (MAL), we aim to determine whether the rapid growth \n",
    "in isekai production has contributed to a decline in average ratings or whether the genre has maintained its popularity. We also wish to see whether episode count or release season has any impact on overall audience rating. \n",
    "\n",
    "In reviewing previous analyses done on anime using data from MyAnimeList, we found that shows with more than 26 episodes seemed to be less popular than shorter series by about 33% (2). Another analysis done on the rise of isekai found that despite the \n",
    "increase in production of the genre isekai’s are still doing very well. Despite community consensus on there being too much isekai, the analysis viewership data shows that the genre has not yet hit the point of diminishing returns and was the second most \n",

    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    ">  Our data relies on MAL ratings which in itself could be biased. It does not represent the whole community and may not proportionally represent anime fans of different regions. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    ">  In our dataset we would not be using any individuals personal information and only use the relevant data like title,genre, members, episode count and averaged ratings. \n",

    "### B. Data Storage\n",

    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "\n",
    ">  We acknowledge that our dataset comes from a subgroup of the whole community and represent more of the international fan base, but for the purpose of our research this is sufficient and we do not need to find other relevant data. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
