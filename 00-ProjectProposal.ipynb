    "Over the last decade anime has become more mainstream and with it isekai has become one of its top produced genres. ”Isekai”, meaning another world in Japanese, refers to a story where the main protagonist is transported, trapped, or reborn into a fantasy world. \n",
    "While the genre has been around since the 1980’s, it wasn't until recently that the genre has really taken off. Just in 2024, the genre made up 15% of new release anime tv shows with 34 isekai being released. However with the rise of the genre, it \n", 
    "has faced increasing criticism from audiences as they feel the genre is being overproduced and filled with unoriginal ideas. (1) \n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing this our group has decided to explore the truth behind how the audience really feels about the genre. By analyzing more than a decade of industry data and user reviews through MyAnimeList (MAL), we aim to determine whether the rapid growth \n",
    "in isekai production has contributed to a decline in average ratings or whether the genre has maintained its popularity. We also wish to see whether episode count or release season has any impact on overall audience rating. \n",
    "\n",
    "In reviewing previous analyses done on anime using data from MyAnimeList, we found that shows with more than 26 episodes seemed to be less popular than shorter series by about 33% (2). Another analysis done on the rise of isekai found that despite the \n",
    "increase in production of the genre isekai’s are still doing very well. Despite community consensus on there being too much isekai, the analysis viewership data shows that the genre has not yet hit the point of diminishing returns and was the second most \n",

    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    ">  Our data is from Kaggle which is a public web scrapped dataset of MAL users. While individuals are not informed about the use of their data we are looking at average/overall ratings rather than information on individual profiles. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    ">  Our data relies on MAL ratings which in itself could be biased. It does not represent the whole community and may not proportionally represent anime fans of different regions. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    ">  In our dataset we would not be using any individuals personal information and only use the relevant data like title,genre, members, episode count and averaged ratings. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> N/A \n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    ">  N/A all the data that we are using is open to the public either through open sourced datasets or API’s therefore anyone could get it, there is no need for protection. \n",

    "\n",
    ">  N/A as we will not be using anyone's personal info just aggregated summaries. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "\n",
    ">  We acknowledge that our dataset comes from a subgroup of the whole community and represent more of the international fan base, but for the purpose of our research this is sufficient and we do not need to find other relevant data. \n",

    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    ">  There is a possibility that when comparing by episode count, longer shows may have higher ratings than shorter ones, but we have not thought of how to address this yet. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "\n",
    ">  Yes, we are not looking at just the ratings but also the number of members to accurately show the popularity of a title. \n",

    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    ">  N/A as we will not be using any individuals personal info. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    ">  Yes all our queries and data visualizations will be posted on the github repo. \n",

    "### D. Modeling\n",

    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    ">  We will be using the overall rating of a show when doing our calculations and we have also considered somehow factoring in members or popularity rank to account for shows with high ratings but low members and vice versa. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "\n",
    ">  N/A \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    ">  N/A \n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "\n",
    ">  N/A \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "\n",
    ">  N/A \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    "\n",
    ">  N/A \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
